I was raised in Oakland, CA, and graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BA in American Studies and Minor in Film and Digital Media. While working for a County Supervisor in the Bay Area I managed the social media presence, website, and created content for the Supervisor's YouTube page. I moved to Southern California where I earned my Masters in Teaching from USC. I am currently a 7th and 8th grade math teacher. I am a member of the Multicultural Leadership Team, Math Task Force, and a faculty representative on the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Once a year, I teach an elective that shows students how to add light saber effects to their choreographed fight scenes. I also love to explore the amazing food found in Los Angeles with family and friends. On the weekends, my wife and I spend lots of quality time with our 4 year-old Corgi, Lucy and her new puppy, Riley.
